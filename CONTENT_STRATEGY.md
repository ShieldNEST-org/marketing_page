## Content Philosophy

### Brand Voice

| Aspect | Guideline |
|--------|-----------|
| **Tone** | Friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful - never aggressive or FUD-spreading |
| **Approach** | Educate and inform rather than hard-sell |
| **CTAs** | Subtle mentions of SHIELDNEST and Coreum benefits without being pushy |
| **Competitors** | Respectful of other chains while highlighting Coreum advantages |

### Core Principles

1. **Hook with trending topics** - Lead with what people are already searching for
2. **Provide genuine value** - Every post should teach something useful
3. **Natural integration** - Coreum benefits feel organic, not forced
4. **Cross-ecosystem appeal** - Content that attracts Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and SUI users
